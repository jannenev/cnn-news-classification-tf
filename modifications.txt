In data_helpers.py added new method data_helper.load_newsdata_and_labels() to load newsdata from pickled file.

Made copies of train.py and eval.py as train2.py and eval2.py. 
In these version2:s the new methods is used to load and use newsdata instead of default data.


## train3.py (modification of train2.py)

Added loading of pretrained embeddings word2vec or glove.
As in https://github.com/cahya-wirawan/cnn-text-classification-tf

data_helpers.py: methods for loading them
config.yml: new config file
train3.py 
   in beginning added loading of embeddings
   under sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer()): Added code for embeddings


baseline.py  calculates baseline predictions with naive bayes and SVM.
   
   
## TO DO

read all features from pickles and save as csv. Then use csv. Add parameter to filename.

Split data to train, test and eval


## modifications_focus
1.data_helper.py
add functions to get the data with focus and make attention matrix
2.text_cnn_focus.py
# Add a placeholder for attention
self.attention = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, sequence_length, 1], name="att")
and add it in the embedding layer
# add attention
self.embedded_chars = tf.concat([self.embedded_chars, self.attention], 2)
embedding_size = embedding_size + 1 # attention
self.embedded_chars_expanded = tf.expand_dims(self.embedded_chars, -1)
3.train2_focus.py
3.1) 
Changed as my tensorflow version is >1.5. Please change back when running in your machine.
#FLAGS._parse_flags() # outdated from tf
# replace by below
FLAGS(sys.argv)
3.2)
load focus, make attention matrix and feed attention to train the model.
Run:
python train2_focus.py --num_epochs=30 --batch_size=1000
