**[This code belongs to the "Implementing a CNN for Text Classification in Tensorflow" blog post.](http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/)**

It is slightly simplified implementation of Kim's [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) paper in Tensorflow.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Tensorflow > 0.12
- Numpy

## Training

Print parameters:

```bash
./train.py --help
```

```
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --embedding_dim EMBEDDING_DIM
                        Dimensionality of character embedding (default: 128)
  --filter_sizes FILTER_SIZES
                        Comma-separated filter sizes (default: '3,4,5')
  --num_filters NUM_FILTERS
                        Number of filters per filter size (default: 128)
  --l2_reg_lambda L2_REG_LAMBDA
                        L2 regularizaion lambda (default: 0.0)
  --dropout_keep_prob DROPOUT_KEEP_PROB
                        Dropout keep probability (default: 0.5)
  --batch_size BATCH_SIZE
                        Batch Size (default: 64)
  --num_epochs NUM_EPOCHS
                        Number of training epochs (default: 100)
  --evaluate_every EVALUATE_EVERY
                        Evaluate model on dev set after this many steps
                        (default: 100)
  --checkpoint_every CHECKPOINT_EVERY
                        Save model after this many steps (default: 100)
  --allow_soft_placement ALLOW_SOFT_PLACEMENT
                        Allow device soft device placement
  --noallow_soft_placement
  --log_device_placement LOG_DEVICE_PLACEMENT
                        Log placement of ops on devices
  --nolog_device_placement

```

Train:

```bash
./train.py
```

## Evaluating

```bash
./eval.py --eval_train --checkpoint_dir="./runs/1459637919/checkpoints/"
```

Replace the checkpoint dir with the output from the training. To use your own data, change the `eval.py` script to load your data.

**Edit a file, create a new file, and clone from Bitbucket in under 2 minutes**

When you're done, you can delete the content in this README and update the file with details for others getting started with your repository.

*We recommend that you open this README in another tab as you perform the tasks below. You can [watch our video](https://youtu.be/0ocf7u76WSo) for a full demo of all the steps in this tutorial. Open the video in a new tab to avoid leaving Bitbucket.*

## Edit a file

You’ll start by editing this README file to learn how to edit a file in Bitbucket.

1. Click **Source** on the left side.
2. Click the README.md link from the list of files.
3. Click the **Edit** button.
4. Delete the following text: *Delete this line to make a change to the README from Bitbucket.*
5. After making your change, click **Commit** and then **Commit** again in the dialog. The commit page will open and you’ll see the change you just made.
6. Go back to the **Source** page.

---

## Create a file

Next, you’ll add a new file to this repository.

1. Click the **New file** button at the top of the **Source** page.
2. Give the file a filename of **contributors.txt**.
3. Enter your name in the empty file space.
4. Click **Commit** and then **Commit** again in the dialog.
5. Go back to the **Source** page.

Before you move on, go ahead and explore the repository. You've already seen the **Source** page, but check out the **Commits**, **Branches**, and **Settings** pages.

## Clone a repository

Use these steps to clone from SourceTree, our client for using the repository command-line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don't yet have SourceTree, [download and install first](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). If you prefer to clone from the command line, see [Clone a repository](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/4whODQ).

1. You’ll see the clone button under the **Source** heading. Click that button.
2. Now click **Check out in SourceTree**. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.
3. When you see the **Clone New** dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if you’d like to and then click **Clone**.
4. Open the directory you just created to see your repository’s files.

Now that you're more familiar with your Bitbucket repository, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can [push your change back to Bitbucket with SourceTree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/iqyBMg), or you can [add, commit,](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8QhODQ) and [push from the command line](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/NQ0zDQ).
